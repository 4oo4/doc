# Restricted access articles

wallabag has a system to get articles behind a paywall, by providing your credentials when the article is fetched.

In version 2.2, only the administrator could put his credentials in a config file, making the feature accessible to all users of the instance. With 2.3, all users have a panel to enter their own credentials.
